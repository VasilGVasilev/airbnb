1. Importing PrismaClient:

```sh
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
```

This line imports the PrismaClient class from the @prisma/client package. PrismaClient is the main entry point for interacting with the database.



2. Declaring a global variable:

```sh
declare global {
    var prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;
}
```
This code snippet declares a global variable prisma with the type PrismaClient or undefined. The declare global block allows you to extend the global scope and define additional global variables with custom types. In this case, **it's creating a global variable to store the PrismaClient instance**.



3. Initializing the PrismaClient instance:

```sh
const client = globalThis.prisma || new PrismaClient();
```
Here, the code creates a new constant client, which either uses the existing global prisma variable or creates a new instance of PrismaClient if the global variable is not defined. This technique ensures that there's only one instance of PrismaClient shared throughout the application.



4. Conditional assignment in development mode:

```sh
if (process.env.NODE_END !== 'production') globalThis.prisma = client;
```

This block checks if the environment variable NODE_ENV is not set to 'production'. If that's the case, it assigns the client to the global prisma variable. This conditional assignment allows you to reuse the PrismaClient instance in development environments to avoid creating a new instance on every request, which can be resource-intensive.



5. Exporting the PrismaClient instance:

```sh
export default client;
```

Finally, the client (which is either the existing global instance or a new one) is exported as the default export of this module. Other parts of the application can now import and use this client to perform database operations.


SUMMARY:
In summary, the provided code ensures that there is only one instance of PrismaClient shared across the application and takes advantage of this singleton pattern in development mode to reuse the instance. This approach helps improve the efficiency of database connections and operations in a TypeScript/Node.js application using Prisma.
