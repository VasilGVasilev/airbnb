**why does useRef hook need angle brackets specifically?**

```sh
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const divRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  // Accessing the current value of the ref
  console.log(divRef.current);

  return (
    <div ref={divRef}>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

**the short answer is that we are in React Component land -> JSX/TSX**


The reason why the useRef hook in React uses angle brackets ("<>" symbols) instead of a colon (":") for specifying types is due to the difference in syntax between TypeScript and React.

In TypeScript, the colon (":") is used for type annotations and type assertions. It is used to explicitly declare the type of a variable or a function parameter. For example, const x: number = 10; declares a variable x of type number.

On the other hand, React uses JSX syntax, which is an extension of JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. In JSX, angle brackets ("<>" symbols) are used to denote HTML elements or React components. For example, <div> represents a div element in JSX.

**When using the useRef hook in React with TypeScript, the angle brackets ("<>" symbols) are used to specify the type argument. This is because JSX syntax already uses angle brackets for denoting HTML elements or React components, so using angle brackets for type arguments is consistent with the JSX syntax.**

By using angle brackets for type arguments, it allows TypeScript to differentiate between JSX elements and type annotations. It ensures that the correct type is being used for the useRef hook and provides type checking and auto-completion for the specified type.

**In summary, the use of angle brackets ("<>" symbols) for specifying types with the useRef hook in React is a convention that aligns with the JSX syntax and allows TypeScript to provide accurate type checking and auto-completion.**

I hope this clarifies why the useRef hook uses angle brackets specifically instead of a colon. Let me know if you have any further questions!
