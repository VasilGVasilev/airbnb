**Forms are uncontrolled by default**
According to the search results, React Hook Form is built with uncontrolled inputs in mind and aims to provide the best performance and minimize re-renders. This means that React Hook Form forms are primarily uncontrolled, but it does provide a wrapper component called Controller that allows you to work with external controlled components if needed.

You can emulate controlled forms via *watch* and *setValues*, because *watch* watches and stores each keystroke then re-renders, thus, we know what is the current input much like (state + onChange + e.traget.value in controlled forms)
