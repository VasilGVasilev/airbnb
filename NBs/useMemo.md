**useCallback caches functions to be outside the render cycle so no re-renders**

**useMemo caches result of calculations so no re-computations**

Both useMemo and useCallback are hooks provided by React to optimize performance in functional components. While they are similar in some ways, there are fundamental differences between them.

1. Purpose:

    useMemo is used to memoize the result of a computation and cache it for future use. It allows you to optimize expensive calculations or complex data transformations that are utilized within the component.
    useCallback is used to memoize a callback function, ensuring that the same function instance is returned unless its dependencies change. It is typically used when passing callback functions as props to child components, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

2. Usage:

**useMemo** takes two arguments: the computation function and an array of dependencies. It returns the memoized result of the computation function.

```sh
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computationFunction, dependencies);
```

**useCallback** takes two arguments: the callback function and an array of dependencies. It returns the memoized callback function.

```sh
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(callbackFunction, dependencies);
```

3. Dependency Management:

    useMemo allows you to specify a list of dependencies. When any of the dependencies change, the computation function is re-executed, and the memoized value is updated only if necessary.
    useCallback also accepts a list of dependencies. However, its primary purpose is to memoize the function instance itself, not the return value. The memoized function is only recreated if any of the dependencies change.

4. Performance Considerations:

    useMemo can be used to compute and cache expensive values, preventing unnecessary re-computation. It is suitable for scenarios where you want to optimize components that rely on computationally heavy operations.
    useCallback is useful to prevent unnecessary re-renders when passing down callback props. It ensures that child components that rely on these callbacks do not re-render unless their dependencies change.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference between the two hooks:
```sh
import React, { useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = ({ largeArray, onClick }) => {
  const filteredArray = useMemo(() => {
    return largeArray.filter(item => item > 100);
  }, [largeArray]);

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    // Handle click logic here
    onClick(filteredArray);
  }, [filteredArray, onClick]);

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
  );
};
```

In the example above, useMemo is used to memoize the filteredArray based on the largeArray dependency. This prevents re-computation of the filteredArray unless the largeArray changes.

Meanwhile, useCallback memoizes the handleClick function, ensuring that the same function instance is returned unless filteredArray or onClick changes. This helps avoid unnecessary re-renders of child components that rely on the onClick prop.

Remember to carefully choose the appropriate hook based on the specific use case to optimize performance in your React components.
